Ensemble Modeling:
Technique where multiple models (often called "base learners" or "weak learners") are combined to solve the same problem in order to improve overall performance.

The idea is: **"a group of models working together performs better than any single one alone."**
Types:
- Bagging: Use several versions of the same machine-learning algorithm.
- Stacking: Ue several different machine-learning algorithms.

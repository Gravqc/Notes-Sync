## What is AI:
##### General Intelligence:
- Computers are good at pattern matching & rules. But these machines do not understand the purpose of the game, or why they are playing. 
	- Ex: computers are good at chess 
- AI: A system that shows behavior that could be interpreted as human intelligence.
- Important to understand if a system is really intelligent or not ? 
	- Ex: Sometimes system's can seem intelligent but they are mindlessly matching patterns.
	- Chinese Room Argument: 
		- Say a phrase in Chinese, look up what the response for that phrase should be .. this is not intelligence. (they do not understand Chinese and have no idea what they are talking about)
		- Ex: Asking ur Siri/Gemini "how are you feeling ? " and reply being "I am fine " does not mean they are smart.... they are just matching ur question with a preprogrammed response. they do not actually understand what you are asking.
- Strong AI & Weak AI:
	- Strong AI: Machine displays all person-like behavior.
	- Weak AI: AI that is confined to a very narrow task.
##### Popular Use Case:
- Predictive AI:
	- Pattern matching based on user data.
	- smaller data. (unique/user)
	- Lower processing power
- Generative AI:
	- Take massive amount of data & build something valuable.
	- larger data.
	- Complex with greater abilities.

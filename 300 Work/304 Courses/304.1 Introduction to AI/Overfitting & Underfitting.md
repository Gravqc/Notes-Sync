### **Underfitting:**

- Model is **too simple**
    
- Fails to capture the underlying pattern in the data
    
- **Poor performance** on both training and test data
    
- Usually caused by **high bias**
    

#### âœ… Real-World Example:

A student didnâ€™t study and guesses randomly â†’ gets most answers wrong  
â†’ **Underfitting**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Overfitting:**

- Model is **too complex**
    
- Learns **noise + details** in training data
    
- Performs **very well** on training data, but **poorly** on unseen/test data
    
- Usually caused by **high variance**
    

#### âœ… Real-World Example:

A student memorizes practice test answers word-for-word. In the real exam with different wording, they struggle.  
â†’ **Overfitting**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Ideal Model:**

- Finds the **right balance** between complexity and generalization
    
- Performs well on both **training and test** data

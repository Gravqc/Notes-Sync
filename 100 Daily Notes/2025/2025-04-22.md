### 📋 Tasks:

		- [ ] business profiles 
	- [ ] Aggregation mail on success/failure of precompute jobs.
	- [ ] JobSet status updation in DataForge.
	- [ ] When should we set precompute request, currently also (6th day)

### 🔁 Habit Tracker:
- [ ] Exercise

#### Notes:
Few Profiles are missing (sub-profiles) these need to be included.
Current:
- Get profiles from jobs & historical jobs and left join with extraction.ProcessedDetailsOfProfileWithDataSource so that we can get the ProcessedDate. (This is used in the historical chunk creation)
- Now we just need to also get the extra subprofilesaliases NOTE: These profiles wont have a processedate but we need to check the parentid of these to get the processed date

Implementation:
- Maybe we should be putting profileId as ParentId for parent profiles.


Idea: 
- A place where people can publish data which is not accessible to ai

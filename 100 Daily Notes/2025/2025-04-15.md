		- [x] Test API & Mongo
			- [x] No Data in precompute store
			- [x] Prev year data only (not able to find) (should behave same as current year)
			- [x] Only current year data 

### üîÅ Habit Tracker:
- [x] Exercise
#### Notes:
- Testing AI Insights Report:
	- When only current year data we are placing null when no data for the range
	- When there is no data in mongo we are putting the heading but no data ... 
		- For overall data we are not putting the columns ... ? 
		- ga4 channel is not getting replaced ? 
			- Basically for this when the data is null then we dont end up putting the columns.
			- in ga channel if mongo and midgard give no data then we just have nothing in the dictionary to map 
				- for overall & channel it is almost impossible to just put the headers for the columns might have to refactor the logic

- create an empty collection with some object with id.
- have a few records
- create a df with same id but new field values and one with new id and new filed and append 

Lets try to run the same notebook and add an ingestion time and check if it is replacing documents with the same id or not 
## Result
- It looks like it will replace the documents that are already present with the same id

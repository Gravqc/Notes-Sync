- Searching for patterns in data:
	- Machine learning systems feed on data to learn new things.
- Robotics:
	- Machines that behave like humans.
	- Robotics + Ml = New options 
		- ex: Self-driving vehicles 
			- cars need to understand when to turn left or right this is the hard part
			- Why this is a data problem not a robotics problem
		- Program a robot to act intelligently:
			- Room cleaning robot uses general AI.
- Natural Language Processing:
	- AI programs do something like nlp.. basically talk with the machine like how you would talk to a human.
	- Machine needs to understand human language (use ANN)
		- google gives email as a free service so they can have that natural language data for their systems.
	- For a system to be considered intelligent it needs to be able to communicate with humans.
- Internet of Things:
	- Alexa: Collect data use that data for a recommendation system based on day-to-day conversation.
	- Smart watch: Pattern matching of health data... 
- Generative Systems:
	- Dalle-2: Image generation system (openAI)
	- Chatgpt: Trained with ml on a deep ANN; is flexible with general knowledge.
		- Trained on trillions of connections of words.
